Among the features examined, facial asymmetry in ASC appears to exhibit the greatest consistency between studies [Hammond et al., 2008; Ozgen et al., 2011, 2013]. There is also some evidence to suggest that ASC-related facial characteristics may correspond with particular cognitive and behavioral traits. Speciﬁcally, reduced maxillary height and increased mouth width may be more common among individuals with ASC who have comorbid intellectual disability, language regression, and greater severity of ASC symptoms [Aldridge et al., 2011; Obafemi-Ajayi et al., 2015]. Findings from one study suggest that decreased mouth width may be more common among individuals with ASC who have an IQ within the normal range and lower symptom severity [Obafemi-Ajayi et al., 2015]. However, these conclusions must be considered preliminary given that the studies in this area have overlapping participant samples.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Investigating facial phenotype in autism spectrum conditions: The importance of a hypothesis driven approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diana Tan","Murray Maybery","Michael Clarke","Renata Di Lorenzo","Melissa Evans","Michael Mancinone","Christina Panos","Andrew Whitehouse"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n","date":1497398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497398400,"objectID":"e53e4de1b893ddee9c7fda96e63f86ca","permalink":"/publication/06-tan-2018-plos/","publishdate":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/06-tan-2018-plos/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"No relationship between autistic traits and salivary testosterone concentrations in men from the general population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Syed Zulqarnain Gilani","Diana Tan","Suzanna Russell-Smith","Murray Maybery","Ajmal Mian","Peter Eastwood","Faisal Shafait","Mithran Goonewardene","Andrew Whitehouse"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"e7aeea70c8faa2939c3d05396bf10bfa","permalink":"/publication/02-gilani-2015-jnd/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/02-gilani-2015-jnd/","section":"publication","summary":"In a recent study, Bejerot et al. observed that several physical features (including faces) of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were more androgynous than those of their typically developed counterparts, suggesting that ASD may be understood as a ‘gender defiant’ disorder. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypermasculinisation account, which proposes that ASD may be an exaggerated form of cognitive and biological masculinity. The current study extended these data by first identifying six facial features that best distinguished males and females from the general population and then examining these features in typically developing groups selected for high and low levels of autistic-like traits. In study 1, three-dimensional (3D) facial images were collected from 208 young adult males and females recruited from the general population. Twenty-three facial distances were measured from these images and a gender classification and scoring algorithm was employed to identify a set of six facial features that most effectively distinguished male from female faces. In study 2, measurements of these six features were compared for groups of young adults selected for high (n = 46) or low (n = 66) levels of autistic-like traits. For each sex, four of the six sexually dimorphic facial distances significantly differentiated participants with high levels of autistic-like traits from those with low trait levels. All four features were less masculinised for high-trait males compared to low-trait males. Three of four features were less feminised for high-trait females compared to low-trait females. One feature was, however, not consistent with the general pattern of findings and was more feminised among females who reported more autistic-like traits. Based on the four significantly different facial distances for each sex, discriminant function analysis correctly classified 89.7% of the males and 88.9% of the females into their respective high- and low-trait groups. The current data provide support for Bejerot et al.’s androgyny account since males and females with high levels of autistic-like traits generally showed less sex-typical facial features than individuals with low levels of autistic-like traits.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Sexually dimorphic facial features vary according to level of autistic-like traits in the general population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Whitehouse","Syed Zulqarnain Gilani","Faisal Shafait","Ajmal Mian","Diana Tan","Murray Maybery","Jeffrey Keelan","Roger Hart","David Handelsman","Mithran Goonawardene","Peter Eastwood"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n","date":1445040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445040000,"objectID":"9073868e74fe9baded4b21b4a90016b9","permalink":"/publication/03-whitehouse-2015-procb/","publishdate":"2015-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/03-whitehouse-2015-procb/","section":"publication","summary":"Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Prenatal testosterone exposure is related to sexually dimorphic facial morphology in adulthood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diana Tan","Suzanna Russell-Smith","Jessica Simons","Murray Maybery","Doris Leung","Honey Ng","Andrew Whitehouse"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   # #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n","date":1437091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437091200,"objectID":"e574b4a6203837ed2c21dbc19a5fa947","permalink":"/publication/01-tan-2015-plos/","publishdate":"2015-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/01-tan-2015-plos/","section":"publication","summary":"The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory posits that autistic traits are linked to excessive exposure to testosterone in utero. While findings from a number of studies are consistent with this theory, other studies have produced contradictory results. For example, some findings suggest that rather than being linked to hypermasculinization for males, or defeminization for females, elevated levels of autistic traits are instead linked to more androgynous physical features. The current study provided further evidence relevant to the EMB and androgony positions by comparing groups of males selected for high or low scores on the Autismspectrum Quotient (AQ) as to the rated masculinity of their faces and voices, and comparable groups of females as to the rated femininity of their faces and voices. The voices of High-AQ males were rated as more masculine than those of Low-AQ males, while the faces of High-AQ females were rated as less feminine than those of Low-AQ females. There was no effect of AQ group on femininity ratings for female voices or on masculinity ratings for male faces. The results thus provide partial support for a link between high levels of autisticlike traits and hypermasculinization for males and defeminization for females, consistent with the EMB theory.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Perceived Gender Ratings for High and Low Scorers on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient Consistent with the Extreme Male Brain Account of Autism","type":"publication"}]
