[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I grew up in Singapore and moved to Perth, Western Australia in 2012 to pursue my Honours and PhD degrees in Psychology in the University of Western Australia (UWA). I completed my PhD in 2018 where I investigated biological mechanisms underlying the development of autism using physical characteristics such as facial structures. Prior to joining Macquarie University in 2021, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Psychological Science in UWA and CliniKids in Telethon Kids Institute where I built on my PhD research by examining facial characteristics expressed as a broad autism phenotype among siblings and parents of children on the autism spectrum. My PhD and early postdoctoral work has equipped me with a critical mind and advanced quantitative research skills. In my current role at AutismMQ, I aim to apply these skills to conduct meaningful and impactful research in collaboration with the autistic and autism community. My current research work involves examining factors influencing the inclusion of autistic individuals in research beyond merely as passive participants but also as active collaborators. I am also interested in understanding stigma and prejudice associated with autism, and the impact of social camouflaging on the wellbeing of autistic people.\n","date":1645574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1645574400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I grew up in Singapore and moved to Perth, Western Australia in 2012 to pursue my Honours and PhD degrees in Psychology in the University of Western Australia (UWA).
